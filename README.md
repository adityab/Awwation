# Awwation 

This is an HTML5 Prezi clone app using SVG and Javascript.
It is made using **SVG-edit**, an awesome client-side SVG editor.
It uses **Sozi** for animating the presentation.  


This is a **Hack** right now, and was written mostly as an experiment to determine how easy it would be to build something like Prezi using modern browser tech. The code is buggy and will hopefully become better  over time. I welcome people to contribute changes once I set the code in order.

The 'results' of the experiment are detailed in my blog post here: http://adityabhatt.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/writing-a-prezi-clone-with-html5-svg-and-javascript/

**This is the Master branch of Awwwation. I am rewriting the code from scratch, nicely in this branch, till it gets to the state of progress in the online gh-pages branch. Then this one will be put online.**
